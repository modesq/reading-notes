## Linear regression

    Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x)

## linear regression in python

    You know that linear regression is a popular technique and you might as well seen the mathematical equation of linear regression. But do you know how to implement a linear regression in Python?? If so don’t read this post because this post is all about implementing linear regression in Python. There are several ways in which you can do that, you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn. But in this post I am going to use scikit learn to perform linear regression.

## scikit learn

    Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.linear_model module which contains “methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables”.

## Types of Linear Regression

- Simple linear regression
  
    1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- Multiple linear regression

    1 dependent variable (interval or ratio) , 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- Logistic regression

    1 dependent variable (dichotomous), 2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- Ordinal regression

    1 dependent variable (ordinal), 1+ independent variable(s) (nominal or dichotomous)

- Multinomial regression

    1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- Discriminant analysis

    1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio)
