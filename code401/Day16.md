## encryption

Encryption is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. The science of encrypting and decrypting information is called cryptography. In computing, unencrypted data is also known as plaintext, and encrypted data is called ciphertext.

## decryption

What decryption means?
Decryption is a process that transforms encrypted information into its original format. The process of encryption transforms information from its original format — called plaintext — into an unreadable format — called ciphertext — while it is being shared or transmitted.

## Cracking the cipher

There are three main techniques he could use: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.

1. Frequency analysis
Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language. We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that.

2. Known plaintext
Another term for the original unencrypted message is plaintext. If the enemy already knew some part of the plaintext, it will be easier for them to crack the rest of the encrypted version.

3. Brute force
There are only 25 possible shifts (not 26 — why not?). The enemy could take some time to try out each of them and find one that yielded a sensible message. They wouldn't even need to try the shifts on the entire message, just the first word or two.
