## The Big-O Notation (O-notation)

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes a function's limiting behavior when the argument tends towards a specific value or infinity. The upper bound of an algorithm's running time is represented by Big-O notation. As a result, it provides the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.

It is widely used to analyze algorithms because it provides the worst-case running time of an algorithm, and we are always interested in the worst-case scenario

To understand Big O notation, consider the following example: O(n2), which is usually pronounced "Big O squared." The letter "n" represents the input size, and the function "g(n) = n2" within the "O()" indicates how complex the algorithm is in relation to the input size

The selection sort algorithm is an example of an algorithm with an O(n2) complexity. The selection sort algorithm iterates through the list to ensure that every element at index I is the list's ith smallest/largest element.
