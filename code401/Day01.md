## Big O Notation and Linked Lists

Big-O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity). Big-O notation can express the best, worst, and average-case running time of an algorithm

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.  The node includes two segments: data and address

## Types And Values in Python

As in many programming languages, a Python assignment statement associates a symbolic name on the left-hand side with a value on the right-hand side. In Python, we say that names refer to values, or a name is a reference to a value

Python keeps track of how many references each value has, and automatically cleans up values that have none. This is called “garbage collection,” and means that you don’t have to get rid of values, they go away by themselves when they are no longer needed.
