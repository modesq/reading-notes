1. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    NoSQL dbs

2. Which type of database is best for scalability?

    SQL dbs

## part 2

1. What does SQL stand for?

    Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?

    database based on the relational model of data

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

4. What is a 'schema'?

    A database schema is the "blueprint" of a database that describes how data may be related to other tables or data models

5. What is a NoSQL database?

    A NoSQL (not only sql) database is a mechanism for storing and retrieving data that is not modeled in the tabular relations used in relational databases

6. How does it work?

    Documents, rather than relational tables, are used to store data in NoSQL databases. Accordingly, we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Pure document - oriented, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases are examples of NoSQL databases

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

     collections of documents

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    MongoDB, because each individual record is stored as a document, which is a collection of fields with a dynamic schema Each collection does not have to have the same set of fields

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    less mature, less flexible queries
